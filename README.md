# LLM Prefix Guidance

## 1) **Data**
-The finalized data from Llama-3-8B-instruct and Llama-3-70B-instruct can be found under "UPDATED_FINAL_DATA.csv".

-This data set includes ~2000 rows for each question and instruction used from the mix_instruct dataset

-The hints given to the small model are derived from the 50 tokens generated by the large model (e.g. 5_token_hint)

-"UPDATED_FINAL_DATA.csv" also contains corresponding small model output after being given the hint (e.g. 5_token_output)

-The LLM_full_output column is the full response of the LLM so we can compare this to the small model with the large models hint
